# Worktrunk Project Configuration
# Copy to: <repo>/.config/wt.toml
#
# Project-specific hooks that run automatically during worktree operations.
# Check this file into git to share hooks across all developers.

# ============================================================================
# Hook Formats
# ============================================================================
# All hooks support two formats:
#
# Single command:
#   post-create = "npm install"
#
# Named table (multiple commands):
#   [post-create]
#   deps = "npm install"
#   build = "npm run build"
#
# Named commands appear in output, making it easier to identify failures.

# ============================================================================
# Template Variables
# ============================================================================
# All hooks support these variables:
#   {{ repo }}               - Repository directory name (e.g., "myproject")
#   {{ branch }}             - Branch name (e.g., "feature/auth")
#   {{ worktree_path }}      - Absolute path to worktree
#   {{ main_worktree_path }} - Absolute path to main worktree
#   {{ default_branch }}     - Default branch name (e.g., "main")
#
# Merge hooks (pre-commit, pre-merge, post-merge) also support:
#   {{ target }}             - Target branch for the merge
#
# Filters:
#   {{ branch | sanitize }}  - Replace / and \ with - (e.g., "feature-auth")
#   {{ branch | hash_port }} - Deterministic port 10000-19999

# ============================================================================
# Hooks
# ============================================================================

# Post-Create: Runs after worktree creation, BLOCKS until complete
# Use for: installing dependencies, setting up databases, copying configs
#
# [post-create]
# deps = "npm ci"
# env = "cp .env.example .env"

# Post-Start: Runs in BACKGROUND after worktree creation (parallel)
# Use for: dev servers, file watchers, background builds
# Output logged to .git/wt-logs/{branch}-project-post-start-{name}.log
#
# [post-start]
# server = "npm run dev -- --port {{ branch | hash_port }}"
# watch = "npm run watch"

# Post-Switch: Runs in BACKGROUND after every switch (parallel)
# Use for: terminal tab naming, tmux window titles, IDE notifications
#
# post-switch = "echo -ne '\\033]0;{{ branch }}\\007'"

# Pre-Commit: Runs before committing during merge, BLOCKS (fail-fast)
# Use for: formatters, linters, quick checks
#
# [pre-commit]
# format = "npm run format:check"
# lint = "npm run lint"

# Pre-Merge: Runs before merging to target, BLOCKS (fail-fast)
# Use for: tests, build verification
#
# [pre-merge]
# test = "npm test"
# build = "npm run build"

# Post-Merge: Runs after successful merge, BLOCKS
# Use for: deployment, notifications
#
# post-merge = "echo 'Merged {{ branch }} to {{ target }}'"

# Pre-Remove: Runs before worktree removal, BLOCKS (fail-fast)
# Use for: cleanup, stopping services
#
# pre-remove = "docker compose down"

# ============================================================================
# Dev Server URL (shown in `wt list`)
# ============================================================================
# [list]
# url = "http://localhost:{{ branch | hash_port }}"
