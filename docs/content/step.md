Run individual git workflow operations: commits, squashes, rebases, and pushes.

## Examples

Commit with LLM-generated message:

```bash
wt step commit
```

Manual merge workflow with review between steps:

```bash
wt step commit
wt step squash
# Review the squashed commit
wt step rebase
wt step push
```

## Operations

- `commit` — Stage and commit with [LLM-generated message](@/llm-commits.md)
- `squash` — Squash all branch commits into one with [LLM-generated message](@/llm-commits.md)
- `rebase` — Rebase onto target branch
- `push` — Push to target branch (default: main)

## See also

- [wt merge](@/merge.md) — Runs commit → squash → rebase → hooks → push → cleanup automatically
- [wt hook](@/hook.md) — Run project-defined lifecycle hooks
