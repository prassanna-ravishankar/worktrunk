Run project-defined lifecycle hooks from `.config/wt.toml`.

Hooks are commands that run automatically during worktree operations (`wt switch --create`, `wt merge`, `wt remove`). Use `wt hook` to run them manually for testing or CI.

```bash
wt hook pre-merge           # Run pre-merge hooks (for testing)
wt hook pre-merge --force   # Run in CI (skip approval prompts)
```

## Hook types

| Hook | When | Blocking | Fail-fast |
|------|------|----------|-----------|
| `post-create` | After worktree created | Yes | No |
| `post-start` | After worktree created | No (background) | No |
| `pre-commit` | Before commit during merge | Yes | Yes |
| `pre-merge` | Before merging to target | Yes | Yes |
| `post-merge` | After successful merge | Yes | No |
| `pre-remove` | Before worktree removed | Yes | Yes |

**Blocking**: Command waits for hook to complete before continuing.
**Fail-fast**: First failure aborts the operation.

### post-create

Runs after worktree creation, **blocks until complete**. The worktree switch doesn't finish until these commands succeed.

**Use cases**: Installing dependencies, database migrations, copying environment files.

```toml
[post-create]
install = "npm ci"
migrate = "npm run db:migrate"
env = "cp .env.example .env"
```

### post-start

Runs after worktree creation, **in background**. The worktree switch completes immediately; these run in parallel.

**Use cases**: Long builds, dev servers, file watchers, downloading large assets.

```toml
[post-start]
build = "npm run build"
server = "npm run dev"
```

Output logged to `.git/wt-logs/{branch}-post-start-{name}.log`.

### pre-commit

Runs before committing during `wt merge`, **fail-fast**. All commands must exit 0 for the commit to proceed.

**Use cases**: Formatters, linters, type checking.

```toml
[pre-commit]
format = "cargo fmt -- --check"
lint = "cargo clippy -- -D warnings"
```

### pre-merge

Runs before merging to target branch, **fail-fast**. All commands must exit 0 for the merge to proceed.

**Use cases**: Tests, security scans, build verification.

```toml
[pre-merge]
test = "cargo test"
build = "cargo build --release"
```

### post-merge

Runs after successful merge in the **main worktree**, **best-effort**. Failures are logged but don't abort.

**Use cases**: Deployment, notifications, installing updated binaries.

```toml
post-merge = "cargo install --path ."
```

### pre-remove

Runs before worktree removal during `wt remove`, **fail-fast**. All commands must exit 0 for removal to proceed.

**Use cases**: Cleanup tasks, saving state, notifying external systems.

```toml
[pre-remove]
cleanup = "rm -rf /tmp/cache/{{ branch }}"
```

### Timing during merge

- **pre-commit** — After staging, before squash commit
- **pre-merge** — After rebase, before merge to target
- **pre-remove** — Before removing worktree during cleanup
- **post-merge** — After cleanup completes

See [wt merge](@/merge.md#pipeline) for the complete pipeline.

## Configuration

Hooks are defined in `.config/wt.toml`. They can be a single command or multiple named commands:

```toml
# Single command (string)
post-create = "npm install"

# Multiple commands (table) — run sequentially in declaration order
[pre-merge]
test = "cargo test"
build = "cargo build --release"
```

### Template variables

Hooks can use template variables that expand at runtime:

| Variable | Example | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `{{ repo }}` | my-project | Repository name |
| `{{ branch }}` | feature-foo | Branch name |
| `{{ worktree }}` | /path/to/worktree | Absolute worktree path |
| `{{ worktree_name }}` | my-project.feature-foo | Worktree directory name |
| `{{ repo_root }}` | /path/to/main | Repository root path |
| `{{ default_branch }}` | main | Default branch name |
| `{{ commit }}` | a1b2c3d4e5f6... | Full HEAD commit SHA |
| `{{ short_commit }}` | a1b2c3d | Short HEAD commit SHA |
| `{{ remote }}` | origin | Primary remote name |
| `{{ upstream }}` | origin/feature | Upstream tracking branch |
| `{{ target }}` | main | Target branch (merge hooks only) |

### JSON context

Hooks also receive context as JSON on stdin, enabling hooks in any language:

```python
import json, sys
ctx = json.load(sys.stdin)
print(f"Setting up {ctx['repo']} on branch {ctx['branch']}")
```

The JSON includes all template variables plus `hook_type` and `hook_name`.

## Security

Project commands require approval on first run:

```
🟡 repo needs approval to execute 3 commands:

⚪ post-create install:
   echo 'Installing dependencies...'

❓ Allow and remember? [y/N]
```

- Approvals are saved to user config (`~/.config/worktrunk/config.toml`)
- If a command changes, new approval is required
- Use `--force` to bypass prompts (useful for CI/automation)
- Use `--no-verify` to skip all project hooks

Manage approvals with `wt config approvals add` and `wt config approvals clear`.

## Examples

### Node.js / TypeScript

```toml
[post-create]
install = "npm ci"

[post-start]
dev = "npm run dev"

[pre-commit]
lint = "npm run lint"
typecheck = "npm run typecheck"

[pre-merge]
test = "npm test"
build = "npm run build"
```

### Rust

```toml
[post-create]
build = "cargo build"

[pre-commit]
format = "cargo fmt -- --check"
clippy = "cargo clippy -- -D warnings"

[pre-merge]
test = "cargo test"
build = "cargo build --release"

[post-merge]
install = "cargo install --path ."
```

### Python (uv)

```toml
[post-create]
install = "uv sync"

[pre-commit]
format = "uv run ruff format --check ."
lint = "uv run ruff check ."

[pre-merge]
test = "uv run pytest"
typecheck = "uv run mypy ."
```

### Monorepo

```toml
[post-create]
frontend = "cd frontend && npm ci"
backend = "cd backend && cargo build"

[post-start]
database = "docker-compose up -d postgres"

[pre-merge]
frontend-tests = "cd frontend && npm test"
backend-tests = "cd backend && cargo test"
```

### Common patterns

**Fast dependencies + slow build** — Install blocking, build in background:

```toml
post-create = "npm install"
post-start = "npm run build"
```

**Progressive validation** — Quick checks before commit, thorough validation before merge:

```toml
[pre-commit]
lint = "npm run lint"
typecheck = "npm run typecheck"

[pre-merge]
test = "npm test"
build = "npm run build"
```

**Target-specific behavior**:

```toml
post-merge = """
if [ "{{ target }}" = "main" ]; then
    npm run deploy:production
elif [ "{{ target }}" = "staging" ]; then
    npm run deploy:staging
fi
"""
```

**Symlinks and caches** — The `{{ repo_root }}` variable points to the main worktree:

```toml
[post-create]
cache = "ln -sf {{ repo_root }}/node_modules node_modules"
env = "cp {{ repo_root }}/.env.local .env"
```
