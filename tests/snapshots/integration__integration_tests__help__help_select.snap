[1m[32mExamples

Open the selector:

  [2mwt select

[1m[32mPreview tabs

Toggle between views with number keys:

1. [1mHEAD±[0m — Diff of uncommitted changes
2. [1mlog[0m — Recent commits; commits already on the default branch have dimmed hashes
3. [1mmain…±[0m — Diff of changes since the merge-base with the default branch
4. [1mremote⇅[0m — Diff vs upstream tracking branch (ahead/behind)

[1m[32mKeybindings

        Key                Action            
   ───────────── ─────────────────────────── 
   ↑/↓           Navigate worktree list      
   Enter         Switch to selected worktree 
   Esc           Cancel                      
   (type)        Filter worktrees            
   1/2/3/4       Switch preview tab          
   Alt-p         Toggle preview panel        
   Ctrl-u/Ctrl-d Scroll preview up/down      

With [2m--branches[0m, branches without worktrees are included — selecting one creates a worktree. This matches [2mwt list --branches[0m.

[1m[32mConfiguration

[32mPager

The preview panel pipes diff output through git's pager (typically [2mless[0m or [2mdelta[0m). Override pager behavior in user config:

  [2m[select]
  [2mpager = "delta --paging=never"

This is useful when the default pager doesn't render correctly in the embedded preview panel.

[1m[32mSee also

- [2mwt list[0m — Static table view with all worktree metadata
- [2mwt switch[0m — Direct switching to a known target branch

Available on Unix only (macOS, Linux). On Windows, use [2mwt list[0m or [2mwt switch[0m directly.
