# Worktrunk

Git worktrees solve a real problem: working on multiple branches without stashing or switching contexts. But the vanilla `git worktree` command is cumbersome. Worktrunk makes worktrees fast and seamless.

## What It Does

Worktrunk wraps git worktrees with shell integration that makes them feel native. Switching to a worktree automatically changes the shell directory. The `wt remove` command returns to the original location.

```bash
# Create and switch to a new worktree in one command
$ wt switch --create fix-auth-bug
✅ Created fix-auth-bug
  Path: /Users/you/projects/myapp.fix-auth-bug

# Your shell is already in the new worktree
$ pwd
/Users/you/projects/myapp.fix-auth-bug

# When done, remove the worktree and return to primary
$ wt remove
✅ Removed worktree: fix-auth-bug
  Returned to: /Users/you/projects/myapp
```

## Why Worktrees Matter

Traditional git workflows present painful tradeoffs:
- Stash work and switch branches (lose environment state)
- Make hasty commits just to check something else
- Clone the repo multiple times (waste disk space, create sync issues)

Worktrees enable multiple branches checked out simultaneously. Each worktree is an independent working directory sharing the same git history. Git's native interface for managing them is verbose and requires manual directory navigation.

Worktrunk provides shell integration that makes `wt switch` actually change directories. No manual `cd` commands or path tracking required.

## Installation

```bash
cargo build --release
# Copy target/release/wt to somewhere in your PATH
```

Shell integration requires adding one line to your shell config:

**Bash** (`~/.bashrc`):
```bash
eval "$(wt init bash)"
```

**Fish** (`~/.config/fish/config.fish`):
```fish
wt init fish | source
```

**Zsh** (`~/.zshrc`):
```bash
eval "$(wt init zsh)"
```

**Nushell** (`~/.config/nushell/env.nu`):
```nu
wt init nushell | save -f ~/.cache/wt-init.nu
```

Then add to `~/.config/nushell/config.nu`:
```nu
source ~/.cache/wt-init.nu
```

**PowerShell** (profile):
```powershell
wt init powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
```

**Elvish** (`~/.config/elvish/rc.elv`):
```elvish
eval (wt init elvish | slurp)
```

**Xonsh** (`~/.xonshrc`):
```python
execx($(wt init xonsh))
```

**Oil Shell** (`~/.config/oil/oshrc`):
```bash
eval "$(wt init oil)"
```

## LLM-Powered Commit Messages

Worktrunk can generate commit messages using an LLM during merge operations. The LLM analyzes the staged diff and recent commit history to write messages matching the project's style.

```bash
# Merge with LLM-generated commit message
$ wt merge main --squash

# Provide custom guidance
$ wt merge main --squash -m "Focus on the authentication changes"
```

Configure the LLM command in `~/.config/worktrunk/config.toml`:

```toml
[llm]
command = "llm"  # or "claude", "gpt", etc.
args = ["-m", "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219"]
```

The LLM receives the staged diff and recent commit messages, then generates a message following project conventions. If the LLM is unavailable or fails, worktrunk falls back to a deterministic message.

## Project Automation

Projects can define commands that run automatically when creating or switching to worktrees. Create `.config/wt.toml` in the repository root:

```toml
# Run sequentially after worktree creation (blocking)
[post-create-command]
"npm install" = "npm install --frozen-lockfile"
"build" = "npm run build"

# Run in parallel after switching (non-blocking)
[post-start-command]
"dev server" = "npm run dev"
"type check" = "npm run type-check -- --watch"

# Validation before merging (blocking, fail-fast)
[pre-merge-check]
"tests" = "npm test"
"lint" = "npm run lint"
```

Template variables expand at runtime:
- `{repo}` - Repository name
- `{branch}` - Current branch
- `{worktree}` - Absolute path to worktree
- `{repo_root}` - Absolute path to repository root
- `{target}` - Target branch (pre-merge-check only)

## Customization

### Worktree Paths

By default, worktrees live as siblings to the main repo:

```
myapp/               # primary worktree
myapp.feature-x/     # secondary worktree
myapp.bugfix-y/      # secondary worktree
```

Customize the pattern in `~/.config/worktrunk/config.toml`:

```toml
# Inside the repo (keeps everything contained)
worktree-path = ".worktrees/{branch}"

# Shared directory with multiple repos
worktree-path = "../worktrees/{main-worktree}/{branch}"
```

### Fast Branch Switching

Push changes from the current worktree directly to another branch without committing or merging. Useful for moving work-in-progress code.

```bash
# Push current changes to another branch
$ wt push feature-experiment
```

Worktrunk stages the changes, creates a commit, and pushes it to the target branch's worktree if it exists.

## How Shell Integration Works

Worktrunk uses a directive protocol. Running `wt switch --internal my-branch` outputs:

```
__WORKTRUNK_CD__/path/to/worktree
Switched to worktree: my-branch
```

The shell wrapper parses this output. Lines starting with `__WORKTRUNK_CD__` trigger directory changes. Other lines print normally. This separation keeps the Rust binary focused on git logic while the shell handles environment changes.

This pattern is proven by tools like zoxide, starship, and direnv. The `--internal` flag is hidden from help output—end users never interact with it directly.

## Commands

**List worktrees:**
```bash
wt list
wt list --branches  # also show branches without worktrees
```

**Switch or create:**
```bash
wt switch feature-branch
wt switch --create new-feature
wt switch --create new-feature --base develop
```

**Run command after switching:**
```bash
wt switch feature-x --execute "npm test" --force
```

**Remove current worktree:**
```bash
wt remove
```

**Push changes between worktrees:**
```bash
wt push target-branch
```

**Merge into another branch:**
```bash
wt merge main                # merge commits as-is
wt merge main --squash       # squash all commits
wt merge main --keep         # keep worktree after merging
wt merge main -m "Custom message instruction"
```

## Configuration

Global config at `~/.config/worktrunk/config.toml`:

```toml
worktree-path = "../{main-worktree}.{branch}"

[llm]
command = "llm"
args = ["-m", "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219"]
```

Project config at `.config/wt.toml` in the repository root (see Project Automation above).

## Design Principles

**Progressive Enhancement**: Works without shell integration. Better with it.

**One Canonical Path**: No configuration flags for behavior that should just work. When there's a better way to do something, worktrunk does it that way by default.

**Fast**: Shell integration overhead is minimal. The binary shells out to git but adds negligible latency.

**Stateless**: The binary maintains no state between invocations. Shell and git are the source of truth.

## Development Status

This project is pre-release. Breaking changes are expected and acceptable. The best technical solution wins over backward compatibility.
